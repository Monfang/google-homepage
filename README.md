## The Odin Project: Fundamentals - Google Homepage 

This project involved looking at the google.com homepage and re-creating it visually. 

Steps taken to achieve this outcome:
1. Created this README.md file 
2. Created index.html, the css folder with style.css inside, and the images folder with the google logo and favicon image
3. Added reset-css.css for good measure after learning about it in a previous topic through the course
4. Added the main elements to index.html incluing the logo, search bar with appropriate icons and buttons to search
5. Added the navigation bar including a link to my GitHub
6. Added the footer navigation
7. Added code to make the site responsive for mobile and tablet
